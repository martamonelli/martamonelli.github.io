I am a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.ipmu.jp/">Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe</a> (IPMU) in Kashiwanoha (Japan).

I am interested in the physics of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and in the development of simulations for the next-generation CMB experiments, LiteBIRD in particular.<br>
So far, my research focused on how half-wave plate (HWP) systematics can impact the science that can be extracted from CMB polarization.
