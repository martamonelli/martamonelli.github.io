I am a Project Researcher (postdoc) at the <a href="https://www.ipmu.jp/">Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe</a> (IPMU) in Kashiwanoha (Japan).

I am interested in the physics of the <b>cosmic microwave background</> (CMB) and in the development of <b>simulations and data analysis tools</> for the next-generation CMB experiments, <b>LiteBIRD</> in particular.<br>
My research focuses on how instrumental systematic effects can impact the science that can be extracted from CMB polarization.
